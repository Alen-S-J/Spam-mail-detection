# Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

This repository contains code and resources for building a spam mail detection model using logistic regression. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. Each email is represented as text data. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model training and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `spam_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of spam mail detection using logistic regression. It includes steps such as data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-mail-detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Run the `spam_detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to update the file paths if necessary.

4. Analyze the results, including the accuracy of the spam mail detection model.

## Results

The results of the spam mail detection can be found in the `spam_detection.ipynb` notebook. The evaluation includes the accuracy score, which indicates the performance of the logistic regression model in classifying spam and non-spam emails.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of logistic regression for spam mail detection. By utilizing the provided code and dataset, researchers and practitioners can develop effective models to identify and filter out spam emails.
